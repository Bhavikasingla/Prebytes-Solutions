Q1 Point out if there is any error in the following code.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int i = 1;
    for( ; ; ) {
        cout<< i;
        if(i>10)
           break;
    }
}
Ans No error

Q2 In the program given below, point out the error, if any, in the while loop.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int i = 1;
    while() {
        cout<< i++;
        if(i>10)
           break;
    }
}
Ans There should be a condition in the while loop.

Q3 Which of the following statements is correct about the program given below?
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 100%90, i;
    for(i = 1; i<=10; i++);
    if(x!=y);
       cout<<"x = "<< x << " " << "y = " << y;
}
Ans The program will produce the output x = 10 y = 10

Q4 Which of the following statement is correct output for the program given below?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i<=127; cout<<" "<< i++);   
}
Ans The program would output 0 1 12 ... 126 127

Q5 Which of the following is correct output for the program given below?
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {
    int i = 0;
    for(; i<5; i++);
        cout<< i;   
}
Ans 5

Q6 Which of the following loops will execute the body of loop even when condition controlling the loop is initially false?
Ans do-while

Q7 Which of these jump statements can skip processing the remainder of the code in its body for a particular iteration?
Ans continue

Q8 What is the output of following code?
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()
{   
     int sum = 0;
     for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < 5 & j < 5; ++i, j = i + 1)
         sum += i;
      cout<< sum;
}
Ans 6
