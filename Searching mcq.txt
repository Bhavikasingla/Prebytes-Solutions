Ans d

Ques 2 Which of the following is not a limitation of binary search algorithm?

must use a sorted array
requirement of sorted array is expensive when a lot of insertion and deletions are needed
there must be a mechanism to access middle element
binary search algorithm is not efficient when the data elements more than 1500

Ans d

Ques 3 Which of the following is not the required condition for binary search algorithm?

Ans c

Ques 4 Where is linear searching used?

When the list has only a few elements
When performing a single search in an unordered list
Used all the time
Both a and b

Ans d

Ques 5 What does the following piece of code do?
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++)
{
  for (int j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++)
  {
      if( (arr[i].equals(arr[j])) && (i != j) )
      {
          cout << arr[i];
      }
   }
}

Print the element with maximum frequency
Print the unique elements in the array
None of the mentioned

Ans a

Ques 6 Which of the following is a disadvantage of linear search?

Not easy to understand
All of the mentioned

Ans b

Ques 7 Given an array arr = {45,77,89,90,94,99,100} and key = 99; what are the mid values(corresponding array elements) in the first and second levels of recursion in Binary Search?

90 and 99
90 and 94
89 and 99
89 and 94

Ans a

Ques 8 Binary Search can be categorized into which of the following?

Brute Force technique
Divide and conquer
Greedy algorithm
Dynamic programming

Ans b

Ques 9 Given an array arr = {5,6,77,88,99} and key = 88; 
How many Binary search iterations are done until the element is found?

1
3
4
2

Ans d

Ques 10 Which of the following is correct recurrence for worst case of Binary Search?

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)
T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)
T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)
T(n) = T(n-2) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)

Ans c

Ques 11 Consider the following C program that attempts to locate an element x in an array Y[] using binary search. The program is erroneous.
f(int Y[10], int x) {
   int i, j, k;
   i = 0; j = 9;
   do {
        k =  (i + j) /2;
        if( Y[k] < x)  i = k; else j = k;
     } while(Y[k] != x && i < j);
         if(Y[k] == x) cout<< "x is in the array " ;
         else cout << " x is not in the array " ;
 }
On which of the following contents of Y and x does the program fail?

Y is [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] and x < 10
Y is [1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19] and x < 1
Y is [2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2] and x > 2
Y is [2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20] and 2 < x < 20 and x is even

Ans c
